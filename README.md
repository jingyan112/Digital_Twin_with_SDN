# Digital_Twin_with_SDN

This repo is for the research project and project course in my second-year master degree.

Basically, in this project, I finished the network topology creation with Mininet container and ONOS container.

And then, based on the prvious step, with RestAPI of ONOS, I finished the implementation of mirroring the network topologies in the second Mininet container and ONOS container.

Meanwhile, I captured the network traffic among the network topology in the first Mininet container and replayed the network traffic in the second Mininet container.

Finally, I finished the automation of building the network topology and mirroring the network topology with Dockerfile and docker-compose.
